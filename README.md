Usadel equation solver for quasi-1D superconductor-normal metal junctions

Code dump of a project I had years ago to calculate the effect of non-equilibrium electron distribution and proximity effect to heat current in some quasi-1D superconductor-normal metal junctions. The code was used to find the results in this article: https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1288 (published version DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.88.075428)

The code is rather messy and not very well written. I might clean it up at some point or not. For someone who wishes to use the code, files starting with example* contain some commented examples on how to do it.

The bvp1lg code included is from python scikits and its license file is included in the directory. As for the rest of the code, do what the fuck you want license (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL) applies.
